This was a really helpful software tutorial. There weren't too many higher order concepts and the software had been updated since this video was created.

It was a super helpful resource though - I have used jMeter before but I think I've got a clearer understanding of each of the features here.

The dashboard to look at the CPU, memory and event loop was cool and Will linked to a lesson on this in the comments [here](https://egghead.io/lessons/node-js-identify-memory-leaks-with-nodejs-dashboard).

## Personal take

This was very clearly a software tutorial and it was useful. It was clear, showed me where the features I needed were and allowed me to follow along and be successful on my own machine.
