This lesson was about wiring up the API to a skeleton React project.

It steps through where you would add the relevant calls to the API and what to do with the response.

The code was pre-hooks and so some of the points made were not necessarily relevant to new code that is being written at the moment.

Things I thought about this lesson:

- Swagger's API documentation means you don't have to guess about initial state. We can use the contract to shape the state in the correct way.

- Will uses Axios as a library for his calls to the API. That's a good library that I've used before.

## Personal take

I know that classes aren't dead and that people can still write new React components using them. For me though, hooks are so much more straight-forward - maybe a lesson 14 alternate with hooks would be helpful for people like me who are put off a bit by classes.
