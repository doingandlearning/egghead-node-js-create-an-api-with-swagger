## Description

In this course, we will build a ToDo API that stores notes using the OpenAPI Specification (Swagger). We will start with a blank API definition using the Swagger Online Editor. The Swagger definition file will be used to create a Node.js API. Along the way, we will discover how to implement additional details required for a fully functional API requests and responses. We will also learn about the powerful capabilities of Swagger to generate server side code and client libraries.
