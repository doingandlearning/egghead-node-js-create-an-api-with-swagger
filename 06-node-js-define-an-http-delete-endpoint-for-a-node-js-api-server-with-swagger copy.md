We are also going to add a delete method on this endpoint in order to delete a todo by id.

Again, I'll type the YAML and then explain it after.

```yaml
paths:
  ...
  /todo/{id}:
    ...
    delete:
      description: "Delete a todo by Id"
      operationId: "DeleteTodoById"
      parameters:
      - name: "id"
        in: "path"
        description: "id of the todo to delete"
        required: true
        type: "integer"
        format: "int64"
      responses:
        204:
          description: "todo deleted"
      x-swagger-router-controller: "DeleteTodoById"
```

Not much new here. We're using a different HTTP verb, delete and giving a different response.

In this instance, we're responding with a 204. That means operation was successful. It is good to have a look at those codes and decide if you're using the most appropriate one.

I find the MDN most useful for that [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

## Personal take

This is a really helpful and clear tutorial that has shown how to set up these endpoints in YAML and have them be generated by Swagger.
